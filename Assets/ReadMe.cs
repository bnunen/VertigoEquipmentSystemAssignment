//Using item: left / right mouse button(depending on the hand)
//Switching auto fire: F key

//Used resources:
//All the visual props are assets from the asset store(also the pistol animation).
//The camera script is also a standard asset.
//The circle for the pointer is also not mine.But I guess you already figured that out.
//The asset store environment that I have used is not efficiently set up.

//I am looking forward to your feedback
